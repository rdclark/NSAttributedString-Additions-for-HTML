# NSAttributedString HTML Additions

This project aims to duplicate the methods present on Mac OSX which allow creation of `NSAttributedString` from HTML code on iOS.

This is useful for drawing simple rich text like any HTML document without having to use a `UIWebView`.

Your help is much appreciated. Please send pull requests for useful additions you make or ask me what work is required.

If you find brief test cases where the created `NSAttributedString` differs from the version on OSX please send them to us!
